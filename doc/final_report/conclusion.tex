We present a User-Friendly IoT Data Management Framework based on Hashemi et al.'s IoT Data sharing model. We successfully implemented our solution and deployed our framework on an Android application and a VM hosted by Amazon EC2 cloud. We simulated the Data Management Protocol proposed by Hashemi et al. and successfully interacted with Data Sources and Data Requesters. Our User Study shows that our solution effectively provided summarized information to end-users to assist their decision making procedures for each data request. While our solution builds on a theoretical data sharing model, we believe our solution provides a useful insight to solving future IoT data sharing problems.
