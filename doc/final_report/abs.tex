We propose an extension framework of Hashimi et al.'s \cite{campbell} IoT blockchain data sharing model. While this data sharing model guarantees transparency of data sharing, users cannot confidently make a coherent decision without effectively summarizing information provided by multiple parties. We introduce a user interface for people who are willing to share data collected by IoT devices. We envision most data requests come from IoT applications as these applications potentially need access to user data to improve quality of service. Our solution assists users by providing sufficient information to decide whether he or she should grant/deny data request from IoT applications or explicit data requests via Messaging Service introduced in Hashimi et al.'s paper. Our solution is composed of front-end Android application that provides an efficient summary of each data object and data request and back-end server, hosted by third-party cloud service providers, that automates communication process between Data Owner, Data Sources and Data Requesters. Our user study shows that our user-friendly application provides sufficient information (by whom the data was requested and which sources collected the data) and guides end-users to make decisions on potentially sensitive data.
