Smaller and more power efficient processors enables almost everything in our life to collect information and access internet. This gave rise to the idea of “Internet of Things” (IoT). 
Rapid expansion of IoT devices brings new technical and privacy related challenges related to it. How do we store the vast amount of data generated by these devices? How do we manage and secure them? And, most importantly, how can we help the data owners to protect their privacy? Many research efforts have been made to address the first two challenges. Among them, Sayed Hadi Hashemi has introduced a framework that allows scalable and secure manipulation of IoT data in his paper “World of Empowered IoT Devices”. However, few have been done to address the last challenge. In this paper, we further improve Sayed’s framework by introducing an intuitive way, in the form of a user interface, for the user to categorize and define access-control policies to his/her data. In addition, we see the trend of processing IoT data on cloud, we add SGX support to the framework to enforce data security in cloud computing environment.

Our main contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item While most systems tag user data from the stand point of the developers, we give users the means to tag data in a way that is intuitive to them. This, combined with an easy-to use user interface, bring the security features to an accessible level to ordinary users.

	\item By adding SGX support, we made the existing framework resilient to security concerns when using an untrusted cloud service platform.
\end{enumerate}
