There exists several challenges to implement our solution for the project.

\begin{enumerate}
\item simulating different parties like DR and DS (potentially simulating IoT applications as well)

\item preparing Intel SGX hardware

\item designing user interface is a hard task

\item Challenges related to user research for app interface: The challenges related to conducting a user research for the mobile app is two fold.

First, we are building an interface for which the backend is unfamiliar, and not available yet. This means that users need to know more background information about the interface for which we seek feedback. In particular, most of the IoT systems that exist now are centralized, and provides coarse-grained permissioning. By contrast, the system that we are targeting is distributed, user-centric, and fine grained in terms of third party data access permissions. Users need to know this to provide effective feedback about the interface.

Second, IoT is still in its infancy, and it's hard to find enthusiast users of IoT devices. We overcome this by treating smartphone sensors as basic IoT devices and building a story for user interaction with the application in terms of sensor data available from smartphones.
